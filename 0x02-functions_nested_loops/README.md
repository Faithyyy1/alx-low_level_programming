Write a function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.Task 12
Write a function that prints the n times table, starting with 0.Task 13
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Write a program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded), followed by a new line.
